        Devil May Cry was meant to be Resident Evil 4 but Staff at Capcom feeling it did not fit with the series
        because of Hideki Kamiya wanted to be to more action than a horror. This would start off to popularize a new genre
        called hack and Slash that would be popular in the 2000,s to the 2010's. The story start off explanation
        about how humans and demons waging war against each other but one demon woke up to justice processed
        fought the demons he would quietly reign humanity. Sparda become a legend and the Legendary Dark Knight.
        With that explanation being done a cutscene show pans out to the sky where woman come of a portal  looking
        around to see a shop named Devil May Cry. It pans inside place to a man named Dante getting a call telling the
        customer that business is close at 9:00PM and then complaining about people having no password, and no real business
        the woman bust down the door with a bike Dante surprisingly  clam and joking about it. The woman talks abouts
        the guy past having to lost his mother and, twin brother and him being the son of Sparda him threatening her at
        his sword point then to she to grab it and electrifying the sword he was holding throws him across the room and,
        toss sword at chest taunting him about his heritage of his father and use of a sword. Decide to throw again with
        the bike at him but with power he used only once in series stops the bike and shoot at it blowing it up and starting
        a fire gets up admits his half demonic side point his pistol at her but the woman name Trish gets up tells him she's
        not his enemy need his help to stop underworld took her sunglasses off Dante looks at her frozen looking like his mother.
        Another explanation but with Mundus who wanted to take control over the human world had his power sealed by Sparda
        want again to control the world at Mallet island. Once there the game starts while playing the camera changes when
        moving into room or area different angles it is called fixed camera angle this was use for Resident Evil 1 - 3. While
        exploring there is shining yellow light when picking it show the yellow orb it brings you back to life when dead in the
        game. There different types of orbs the red orbs is sort of money in help with upgrades like combos, damages for guns,
        and increase for health, and there green orbs it is an orb the regain health, blue orbs increase health there secret rooms that
        has blue orbs with them which either hard or accidentally find them, purple orbs increase this thing called devil trigger.
        When getting inside the castle where you place big room with a door that you have pay luckily there red ords all over the room
        once paying it there other room with orange door thankfully no paying for when going inside next to it there is a round stair
        that you have to go all the way up to get a key, once getting it this is first encounter one of the enemies they are a puppet with
        sharp object on their hand they are not that difficult unlike the others enemies that either block attacks or grab you and dealing damages from it.
        Once you find sword name Alastor it is basically replacement force edge which both have the same move sets since both of are swords,
        but the difference that Alastor has devil trigger which is a power up with different moves paid with red orbs like air hike which is double jump,
        and vortex is flying while in devil trigger. That all I have say since it will take long time talk about this game the good thing it is still manageable
        to beat.
